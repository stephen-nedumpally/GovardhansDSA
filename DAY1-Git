Day 1 : 29/10/2024

Special Thanks to Kunal Kushwaha

1. Initialising Git -> git init
This would create .git file that tracks the changes in a project
2. Checking the changes in a project -> git status
This would show Changes not staged for commit, and changes added to commit

A great example Kuna uses in the video is a photoshoot session in a wedding.
People in the wedding->People queuing near the stage for photos->People taking pictures->Photographs being stored to the album >>
Files in the project being tracked by .git-> 
3. We use git add . to add changes to be committed-
4. git commit -m "Msg to be added"
